# Problem: Object detection (human) in factory
- Re-train (validate) model using custom data (data collected from Rostek customerâ€™s warehouse) or come up with our own architecture for NN. If using open source data, collect it and dive in to understand how they organized their data.
    - Ask Rostek team helping collect some data 
    - Understand how open source projects organize data. Do creating our own data if necessary
    - Play with models, code, inference
- Optimize/Quantize using openvino c++ framework
- Run inference on a ROS node with input from Intel RealSense (D435/D455) and publish in a defined message format
